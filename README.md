# Simple-Ordering-System

Customers can place multiple orders and each order can have multiple items or multiple pieces
of the same item. Based on the volume of orders( or the number of orders) the customer is
eligible for a different amount of discounts.
Say a customer who has placed more than 10 orders is eligible for a 10% discount from the 11th
order onwards and a customer who has placed more than 20 orders is eligible for a 20%
discount.
Annually during BFCM, all customers are eligible for an additional 15% discount based on their
tier. How will you allocate this discount to every order?
Please translate the above problem into a requirement document.
